README for project 1 - exploratory data analysis
========================================================
All the .R code perform the download and extracation of the data : 4 R codes are in the github repository one for each plot.
Take care for setting the working directory (first line of the code). The file is downloaded to a Data directory and figures are produced in a Figures directory.
The main dataframe extracted from the original file is called **epc**, in the 4 .R files.

The plots are available in the figure directory.

I also put uiin the repository the "cookbook" (.Rmd .md and .html files produced by knitr) explaining the different steps.But knitr produced the plots in html file.
